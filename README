Use Case
-------------

jQuery Haversine is useful if you need to determine the distance between two points on a map. There are lots of obvious use cases for location-based data where you need to calculate the distance between a user’s current location and a number of search results. For example, a restaurant search in a particular neighourhood.

Instructions
-------------

jQuery Haversine is called with:

$.haversine(lat1,long1,lat2,long2,unit);

This will return the distance between the two lat/long values in the specified unit. Future versions will allow you to specify a custom sphere radius (with the Earth’s radius set as a default).

You can pass the arguments as an integer (floating point included) or numeric string - the plugin uses parseFloat() to extract whatever gets passed.

Distance paramter expects "km" for kilometres, or anything else for miles.
